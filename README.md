Supplemental Table 9 Differentially Expressed Genes Between Pretreatment- and Posttreatment Status in Cluster 1 Exhausted CD8 T cells in responders

Fig. S1 Specific Comparison of Each Ligand-receptor Interaction in Pretreatment responders with Each Ligand-receptor Interaction in Pretreatment Nonresponders. Notes, a Ratio (pretreatment responders/nonresponders) >1 indicates that a higher interaction intensity existed in responders than in nonresponders (shown in red). A Ratio (pretreatment responders/nonresponders) <1 indicates that a lower interaction intensity exists in responders than in nonresponders (shown in blue).

Fig. S2 Overlapping Genes Between Our Ligand or Receptor Genes and the 693 Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) Identified in the Hugo et al. Study Between Pretreatment Responders and Pretreatment Nonresponders. Notes, a Ratio (pretreatment responders/nonresponders) >1 indicates that a higher interaction intensity existed in responders than in nonresponders (shown in red). A Ratio (pretreatment responders/nonresponders) <1 indicates that a lower interaction intensity exists in responders than in nonresponders (shown in blue).

Fig. S3 Relative Differences (Responders vs. Nonresponders) in Changes from Pretreatment to Posttreatment Status. Notes, a “Relative Ratio” between responders and nonresponders >1 means that the interaction intensity was relatively increased in responders or relatively decreased in nonresponders during treatment (shown in red). A “relative ratio” between responders and nonresponders <1 means that the interaction intensity was relatively decreased in responders or relatively increased in nonresponders during treatment (shown in blue).

Fig.S4 Overlapping Genes Between Our Ligand or Receptor Genes and with 2,670 DEGs that changed differentially from pretreatment to posttreatment status between responders and nonresponders in the Riaz et al. study. Notes, a “Relative Ratio” between responders and nonresponders >1 means that the interaction intensity was relatively increased in responders or relatively decreased in nonresponders during treatment (shown in red). A “relative ratio” between responders and nonresponders <1 means that the interaction intensity was relatively decreased in responders or relatively increased in nonresponders during treatment (shown in blue).

Fig. S5 DEGs and GSVA between CAFs and Myofibroblasts.

Fig. S6 Validation of the Ligand/receptor Expression Patterns Identified in Our Study with Other Immunotherapy Datasets using the TIDE Platform. Notes, genes that showed all red or all blue indicated a high correlation with immunotherapy response.
